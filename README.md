# sketchpad

This project is to create a browser based sketchpad with the following features:
	- A grid will show the area that can be used for sketching
	- hovering over each square in the grid will change the colour of that square
	- There will be a 'clear' button which will clear the colours of all squares in the grid
	- The clear button will also prompt the user to enter the number of squares they would like in the next grid.

This project is from https://theodinproject.com/ as part of the Web Development 101 session.

Hover functionality is working with the default colour currently as Red. 

Next step is to create a random colour generator. Each time the cursor hovers over a square, the generator will select a new colour for that square to change to.


UPDATE: Random colour generator created. This changes the colour of the current square each time it is hovered over. Next step is to prevent a square from changing colour once it has already been changed from white.
